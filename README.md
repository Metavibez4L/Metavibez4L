Welcome to my hub. I'm Brandon, the technical and CTO of **Big Vision Pictures (BVP)** — the world’s first crypto-native film and television studio. My work lives at the intersection of blockchain infrastructure, decentralized finance, and immersive entertainment.

## 🛠️ Core Specializations
- **Smart Contract Development**  
  `Solidity` · `Rust` · `Foundry` · `Hardhat` · `UUPS Proxy Patterns` · `Staking Contracts`

  `Arbitrum Orbit` · `Nitro` · `ERC-4337` · `Modular L3 Subchains` · `Custom Gas Tokens (BVPTOKEN)`

- **Ecosystem Integrations**  
  `DAO Tooling` · `Gas Abstraction` · `Meta-Transactions` · `Solana RPC / SPL Tokens` · `DeFi Protocols (Aave, Uniswap, GMX)`

- **Security & Governance**  
  `Certik Audits` · `Multisig Wallet Ops` · `Gnosis Safe` · `Role-Based Access` · `Governance Participation via $ARB`

## 🔗 Blockchain Infrastructure
- **Arbitrum L2**: Live deployment of BVP ERC-20 + staking on Arbitrum Sepolia. Built UUPS upgradeable staking/gas router system.
- **Orbit Subchain**: Architecting custom L3 for on-chain film financing, token-gated production budgets, and real-time fan governance.
- **Bridges**: Implementing L2-native bridges for BVP ⇆ USDC/ETH/ARB transfer and liquidity bootstrapping.

## 🧱 Project Highlights
- 🎥 **Crypto-Powered Studio**: BVP operates as a blockchain-native media engine, minting funding + fan engagement into real-world IP.
- 🚀 **Subchain Design**: Full-stack Orbit L3 enabling gasless user flows, NFT campaigns, and DAO-powered creative input.
- 🔐 **Security First**: Multi-layer wallet protection, automated fund flows, 2FA hardware-level ops, Certik-reviewed smart contracts.
- 🗳️ **DAO Alignment**: Deep integration with Arbitrum DAO — including governance participation, grant campaigns, and co-audits.
